# Normally @libdir@ would be the place where libraries are installed by this
# autoconfiscated package. We need to load libeanticxx with cling at runtime.
# This usually works by just searching for it in @libdir@, however, in some
# setup (e.g., installs into a different prefix,) the library might not be in
# that prefix but still on the search path somehow. Thefore we parse all of
# LDFLAGS here so we do not miss our library at runtime. This is a bit hacky,
# and a more robust approach that also make distcheck work would be
# appreciated.
